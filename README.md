# ACTS Attacs on McElliece presentation
 
A demo for the 'Attacs Against McElliece Cryptosystem' presentation on the 'Applications of Coding Theory to Security' course. This Sage implementation demonstrates a random selection attack against a relatively small Goppa code, and the improved j-algorithm with j=2. The random parts are seeded to ensure a short enough running time for the presentation, but one can comment out the seeds to get different results.
